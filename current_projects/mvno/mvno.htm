<h1>A First Look at Performance in Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs)</h1>
<h3><big>Overview</big></h3>
<big>Recent industry trends suggest a new phenomenon in the mobile
market: mobile virtual network operators or MVNOs that operate on top of existing cellular infrastructures. While MVNOs have
shown significant growth in the US and elsewhere in the past two
years and have been successful in attracting customers, there is
anecdotal evidence that users are concerned about cellular performance when choosing MVNOs over traditional cellular operators.
<br>
<br>
However, no previous work has systematically analyzed performance in MVNOs. To address this gap, we present the first systematic measurement study to shed light on this emerging phenomenon. We study the performance of 3 key applications: web access, video streaming and voice, in 6 popular MVNOs in the US running atop 2 major base carriers. We refer to the base carrier 
 along with its MVNOs as an &quot;MVNO family&quot; or just &quot;family&quot;. We observe that some MVNOs do indeed exhibit 
significant performance degradation and that there are key differences between the two MVNO families.

<h3><big>Carriers Examined</big></h3>
<big> 
We studied performance in the following popular T-Mobile MVNOs: StraightTalk, SIMPLEMobile and MetroPCS. We also studied 
 performance in the following popular AT&amp;T MVNOs: Net10 Wireless, H20 Wireless and Black Wireless.
</big>

<h3><big>Highlights</big></h3>
<big>
We list below some of our observations that we found interesting. Please read our publication below for more details. 
<br>
<br>
1. Some MVNOs perform significantly worse than other MVNOs interms of web access and video streaming.
<br>
2. The base carrier usually performs better than its MVNOs.
<br>
3. Overall, one MVNO family performs worse than the other MVNO family interms of web and video access. 
<br>
4. The carriers performed similarly w.r.t call setup time and audio quality.
