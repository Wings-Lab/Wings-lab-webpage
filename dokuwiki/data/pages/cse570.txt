====== CSE 570 Wireless/Mobile Networking (Fall 2014) ======

==== Grading ====
Occasional quizzes and homeworks (33%), midterm and final exam (33%), term project -- in groups of 2-3, solo project is also acceptable, but not ideal (34%). If significant work is done in project -- specifically developing a useful tool or analysis, you can choose to shift more weight to the project.

==== Term Project ====

== Ground Rules ==

Typically 2-3 students per project. A proportionately more complete work is expected from a 3 students group than 2. (You can also go solo if you like; but it is easier to work in a group as projects could be involved and also it is easier for us to manage projects if there are fewer of them.)

Several ideas are provided in a following ideas document. This document will be evolving within the next week. You are not limited to these ideas. But these are the ideas we have some concrete interest in and so they are fairly well-defined and also novel. 

Your eventual deliverable is a report plus necessary code/prototype system as appropriate. 

== Time line ==

Expect to provide intermediate checkpoints. Each checkpoint is a short progress report describing your project, scope of work, your approach, etc plus activities undertaken/results obtained including next steps. Checkpoints are optional. They are used to monitor progress and gather feedback; they are not used for grading. But experience has shown that students who miss checkpoints or do poorly at checkpoints also do poorly in the project. Each project will need to be demoed and also a final report is to be submitted.

  * Checkpoint 1 -<del> Oct 15</del> Oct 22 
  * Checkpoint 2 - <del> Nov 10 </del> Nov 12
  * Demo  - Nov 25 
  * Final report due - <del> Dec 2 </del> <del> Dec 10 </del> Dec 13 

Your grade will depend on both the demo (what is working, how well) and also the report (how well you can describe the problem you are trying to address, related work and your approach/results). Grade will also depend on the complexity of your project/scope of work. 

== Guideline for Project Report ==

The best report is about 4-6 pages formatted just like a research paper. Just like a research paper, your report should have an introduction that introduces the problem you are solving and provides appropriate background. Then it discusses the methodology. Here you describe, for example, your experimental platform, experimental design, rationale for such design, any limitations/approximations, data collection and analysis or software development effort as appropriate, etc. Then the report provides the actual results and observations. Finally, it concludes with a summary of the work and pointers to future work. Note that this is a general guideline only and specifics will depend on your actual work. 

Though you will not be penalized for longer or shorter reports or using a different format, try to limit to 4-6 pages assuming you are formatting as typical research papers are formatted (e.g., 11 point times roman font, double column, 0.5-1 inch margin on sides, tightly integrated figures/plots/charts etc. Also, be careful in choosing what data to present and how. Do not try to present everything that you have collected. For example, a single plot can be more informative than printouts of pages of tables/data. Similarly, refrain from providing code as a part of the report. However, pseudo code is fine if it highlights a core point. When presenting plots, make sure to label the axes. Provide captions to all figures and plots. If there is anything non-essential you want to discuss in the report, relegate that to an appendix.

To summarize, your report should be a cogent, easily readable technical document and not a journal log or dump of your work. It should highlight real technical challenges and solutions you developed. It should be written in a focused fashion with a goal to educate and inform the reader rather than to confuse. This is the reason it best to stick to the page limit guidelines above. No project really needs more than this amount of space to clearly present and explain the contributions.  

You will have an opportunity to submit code and data separately with the report.
