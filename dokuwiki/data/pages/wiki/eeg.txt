====== Opportunistic advertisement insertion in online media using neuro-sensors and gaze tracking ======

===== Background / Motivation / Problem =====
  * Current day advertisement insertion is more based on passive techniques (user's history, media content). e.g., use predetrmined ad slots. (Ref ?)
    * Doesn't depend on the user's current state / activity. (Ref ?)
    * Doesn't guarantee whether user was at all expecting to see an advertisement. (Ref ?)
    * Might have distracted the user as well. Impact both on the advertiser as well as the content provider! (Ref ?)
    * Advertiser's ROI for ads might systematically decrease for wrong placement of ads. (Ref ?)

  * Scope / Applicability / Use cases
    * Online Gaming
    * Streaming Video e.g., Vimeo, Youtube etc. 
    * others: judiciously use bandwidth
