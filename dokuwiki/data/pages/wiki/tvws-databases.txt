====== Spectrum Sensing with Mobile SDRs ======

==== Things to focus on ====
  * Efficient radio environment mapping
    * Explore interpolation techniques
    * How much labeled data reuired for interpolation?
    * Information theoretic measure for labeled data's contribution to interpolation errors

  * Reducing deployment cost for sensors
    * Cheap sensors
    * Handling noisy sensor data
    * Strategic deployment
    * Minimization of driving effort

  * Energy Efficiency
    * Studying energy profiles for various platforms, formulating any empirical 
    * How efficient scheduling can improve energy eficiency
 
  * Scanning Strategies
    * Limited sampling rate, making best use of it.(also look Dina Katabi's work)
    * Freq vs. Geographic coverage
